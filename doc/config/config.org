Plugins is a list of plugins (or psuedo-plugins using functions) and their configuration.

Each entry in the list is labelled with a plugin name which maps to information about the plugin, like whether it is enabled or it's settings.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
  "plugins": {
      "crappy.startup.theme": {
          "enabled": true,
          "settings": {
              "file": "/usr/share/awesome/themes/default/theme.lua",
              "font": "sans 10"
          }
      },
      ...
      "crappy.startup.menubar": {
          "enabled": true
      }
  }
#+END_SRC
